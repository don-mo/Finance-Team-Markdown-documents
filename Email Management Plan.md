**Email Management Plan**

---

### **1. Use an Email Delegation System**

#### **Rotational Email Duty**
- Assign one person per week as the primary email responder. This person is responsible for monitoring the inbox during their assigned week.
- Team members not on duty only step in for urgent issues or emergencies.
- Anyone interested in helping the finance team track emails, as missing emails is a crucial mistake to avoid, is welcome to assist in monitoring or supporting email responses.

#### **End-of-Day Review**
- The co-lead or another senior member performs a final daily check of the inbox to ensure no critical messages are overlooked.

### **2. Adopt Shared Email Management Tools**

#### **Use Trello to Manage Emails**
- **Log Incoming Emails:** Emails that require action should be logged as tasks on a Trello board.
- **Assign Tasks:** Assign these tasks to relevant team members, adding due dates to ensure timely responses.

#### **Guide for Using Trello**
- **Workspace:** The shared environment where all boards related to team tasks are housed. Ensure every finance team member joins the workspace.
- **Board:** A Trello board is a specific project or workflow. For email management, create a board named "Finance Team Emails."
- **Task (Card):** Each email that requires action is added as a card on the board. Cards should include:
  - A clear title summarizing the email topic.
  - A description of the email content and any necessary steps.
  - Assigned team members and due dates.

#### **Setup Instructions**
1. Ask all team members to create a Trello account if they donâ€™t already have one.
2. Share the workspace invitation link with all finance leads and other leadership members.
3. Explain the workflow for logging and responding to emails related to "Education," "Onboarding," "Tech," "Communications," "Finance," and "Design" teams.

### **3. Establish Office Hours for Communication**

#### **Definition of Email Office Hours**
- Email office hours are dedicated times when a finance lead focuses exclusively on managing and responding to emails.

#### **Schedule**
- Designate Mondays and Thursdays as email office hours.
- Each session should last 1-2 hours.
- Rotate responsibility among finance leads to distribute the workload evenly.

---

### **4. Automate Responses for Low-Priority Emails**

#### **Use Auto-Replies**
- Set up automated responses to acknowledge receipt of emails and set expectations for response times.
- Example Auto-Reply:
  > "Thank you for your email. Our finance team will review this and respond within 48 hours."

---

### **5. Train Another Team Member as a Backup**

#### **Backup Training**
- Identify a non-finance co-lead or a reliable member of another team to train as a backup email manager.
- Training should cover:
  - How to access and navigate the finance email inbox.
  - Basic guidelines for triaging emails.
  - When to escalate issues to finance leads.

#### **Benefits**
- Reduces workload on finance leads during busy periods.
- Ensures continuity in email management if a finance lead is unavailable.
